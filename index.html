    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Why does this website look so dated?</h3>
    <p>
      This website uses just HTML, which means there isn't any style, colors, or
      fancy functionality. Even though it looks like a website from the 90s,
      this website was coded it up on June 18th, 2022. (Nothing significant
      about the date, it's just when I took the time to do it).
    </p>
    <h3>What is "HTML", anyway?</h3>
    <p>
      The techy definition: HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language". This
      website file is stored on a server somewhere, and when you clicked on the
      link to get here, that server sent the files to your browser (hopefully
      Chrome).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you didn't use a browser to look at this website, it'd look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="html_website_screencapture.JPG" alt="html code" />
    <p>The non-techy definition: it's like using Word. For everything.</p>
    <h3>Why did you code up this site?</h3>
    <p>
      Cuz coding is fun. And I wanted to practice building a website, using just
      HTML.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is there a random inspirational mountain picture?</h3>
    <p>Because it's inspirational. And mountains are cool.</p>
    <h3>Do you have any funny memes on this website?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. <a href="memes.html">Click here</a>for memes!</p>
